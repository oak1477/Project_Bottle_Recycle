# Project_Bottle_Recycle

  Every year, Americans throw away 35 billion plastic water bottles that take approximately 450 years to decompose. Team Re:Engineering has come up with an open source and affordable solution to turn plastic water bottle regrind in to 3D printable pellets. To achieve this, the team has created a modular polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycling system which processes regrinded PET plastics. The output product is uniform pellets which can be used directly by re:3D for their Gigabot X pellet extrusion 3D printer. Using a modular system comprised of a heat pipe operation vacuum dryer and off the shelf plastic extrusion components, the team was able to create a hackable and easy to replicate system. As part of this, a custom control system was also developed to allow for easy operation and use of each ecosystem component. The prototype operated at a processing rate of two pounds per hour at standard operating conditions. A final product of 3x3 mm PET pellets with a molecular moisture content less than 0.02 percent was the goal. This project demonstrates the feasibility of small batch onsite recycling of plastic waste to be reused in additive manufacturing. The prototype was unable to effectively produce consistent size and quality pellets that are capable of being used in the clientâ€™s printer, but the system was able to produce an output at the rate necessary to keep up with the throughput of the printer.
